#### About

Hi. I'm [Martin Ahindura](https://app.rimuut.com/user/tinitto). I'm just a guy loved by the LORD. I write software and some people assume that I am a software engineer. But really, my identity is in the One who created me for Himself, the LORD.

I sometimes hang around at [SopherApps](https://sopherapps.com) doing a bunch of things here and there. Some people like to think of me as the founder of SopherApps. The honest truth is I tried to create SopherApps back in 2016-2018 and failed miserably. It is the LORD who resurrected it three years later in 2021. Even the projects therein are directed by Him.

I do full-stack engineering. I mainly use python, golang, rust, Typescript and JavaScript (vanilla or react). I also work with Nodejs but I am not a big fan of that at this time. I share the same sentiment when it comes to flutter and php.

I usually enjoy manipulating data and so you will find most of my open source projects are about data e.g. embedded data stores, ETLs, message queues etc. 

You might also find a few projects created by me on [pypi](https://pypi.org/user/tinitto/), and again under [SopherApps pypi account](https://pypi.org/user/sopherapps/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~tinitto).

Apart from software, I write [blogs](https://martinahindura.medium.com/).
